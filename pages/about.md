Finally, I have settle on a media I will be using to document and display my personal thoughts! 

# Contents
This 
is a 
website 
that I will be using the record random thoughts and note for both 
personal, work and/or hobby related topics. Everything on this website will be public, thus I will avoid using specific names of individuals,
and also avoid posting sensitive, work related results directly on this website.

Regarding posts associated with real-life events and/or issues, I will attempt to fact check as much I needed, 
listing the available sources at the bottom of the post.

If however, you find a post with sensitive personal or professional contents that you find possibly infringing, or find that a source material is 
in-appropriate, outdated, or controversial in accuracy, contact me immediately, and I will attempt to update/remove the content as fast as I can.


# Commenting
Commenting on any post is welcome (you will need a google+ account to be able to post comments).
While I wouldn't remove any comments, be sure to keep in mind that you are still communicating with a human being rather that works on your screen, 
and treat everyone else as a decent human being should.
