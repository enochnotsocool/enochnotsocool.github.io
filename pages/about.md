## Who am I?

For the technical details: I am currently a graduated student majoring in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) at [National Taiwan University](http://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), with my main focus being [experiemental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) [high energy particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics). My academic related interests include (though not limited to) non-linear dynamics and scientific computing. For those who are more interested in details, feel free to check out my [spec sheet]({{site.url}}/pages/spec/).


## Contents of this site

This is a website that I will be using the record and note for both personal, work and/or hobby related topics. Everything on this website will be public, thus I will avoid using specific names of individuals, and also avoid posting sensitive, work related results directly.

The nessecity to record thoughts varies wildly with topics. So though my main field of study is physics, it would be difficult to write physics related posts that as complete and informative as that of written media or other porfessional websites. In which case I might simple list a source. This website will therefore mainly compose of technical recipes that I might stumble upon, or about topics that I think is worth discussing my own words.

Regarding posts associated with real-life events and/or issues, I will attempt to fact check as much I needed, listing the available sources at the bottom of the post. If however, you find a post with sensitive personal or professional contents that you find possibly infringing, or find that a source material is in-appropriate, outdated, or controversial in accuracy, contact me immediately, and I will attempt to update/remove the content as fast as I can.


## Commenting
Commenting on any post is welcome (you will need a google+ account to be able to post comments). While I wouldn't remove any comments, be sure to keep in mind that you are still communicating with a human being rather that works on your screen, and treat everyone else as a decent human being should.
