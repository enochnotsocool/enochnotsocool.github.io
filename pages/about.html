Finally, I have settle on a media I will be using to document and display my personal thoughts!

<h1>Experiences</h1>
{% for school in site.date.about.experiences %}
   {{ school }}
{% endfor %}


<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>
This is a website that I will be using the record random thoughts and note for both personal, work and/or hobby related topics. Everything on this website will be public, thus I will avoid using specific names of individuals, and also avoid posting sensitive, work related results directly on this website.
</p>

<p>
Regarding posts associated with real-life events and/or issues, I will attempt to fact check as much I needed, listing the available sources at the bottom of the post.
</p>

<p>
If however, you find a post with sensitive personal or professional contents that you find possibly infringing, or find that a source material is in-appropriate, outdated, or controversial in accuracy, contact me immediately, and I will attempt to update/remove the content as fast as I can.
</p>


<h2>Commenting</h2>
Commenting on any post is welcome (you will need a google+ account to be able to post comments).
While I wouldn't remove any comments, be sure to keep in mind that you are still communicating with a human being rather that works on your screen,
and treat everyone else as a decent human being should.
