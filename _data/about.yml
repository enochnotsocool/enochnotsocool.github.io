tools:
   - name: C++
     icon: https://isocpp.org/files/img/cpp_logo.png
     stars: 5
     level: advanced
     general: Adept with framework design, using both the old pointer style syntax, or the newer template/reference style synctax. Rudementary knowledge of fundemental computing data types and memory interaction/handling concepts.
     specifics:
       - 'The new standards:
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11">C++11</a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14">C++14</a>.
          Knows enough for template/reference style style designs, yet to unleash the full power of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">Lambda expresions</a>.'
       - 'The pre-standard general purpose library: <a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a>.
          Mainly to assist with better user interaction experience (boost::program_options),
          and file/string parsing (boost::property_tree, boost::format... etc.).'
       - 'High energy physics libraries:
         <a href="https://root.cern.ch/">ROOT</a>,
         <a href="https://root.cern.ch/roofit">ROOFIT</a>,
         <a href="http://cms-sw.github.io/">CMSSW</a>.
         More experienced with the classes and methods associated with "classical" methods of analysis, and not the more fancy, machine-learning like methods.'
       - 'C style mathematics libraries: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GSL</a>.'
       - 'Familiar with the makefile/cmake design structure, but a bit out of practice.'

   - name: Python
     icon: http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/cornmanthe3rd/plex/128/Other-python-icon.png
     stars: 4
     level: high-intermediate
     general: Familiar working with python flavoured object orientated programming syntax (comprehensive array... etc.). Knows enough to pick up a new library when ever needed, and in principle is able to create and design custom python packages, though not experienced enough in the python way for a non-me human to find the packages useful. Mainly using python for high level user interfacing (command line interactions, mini-shells... etc).
     specifics:
       - 'User interfacing libraries: argparse, Commandline... etc.'
       - 'Mathematics library: Numpy, Scipy, PyRoot.'
       - 'System interfacing librarys: sys, subprocess... etc.'
       - 'C++/python interfacing using boost::python.'

   - name: Latex/Tex
     icon: http://4vector.com/thumb_data/afd-56603.jpg
     stars: 3
     level: intermediate
     general: Package custumisation and basic layout and symbol desgins. Knows enough about typography and typesetting to annoy those who don't, though independent layout design is mostly trail and error progresses rather than constructive interations. Also experience with mathematical element creation with packages such as tikz.
     specifics:
        - <a href="https://github.com/yimuchen/UnixConfig/tree/master/TexSettings">Custom .sty files</a> I made because I feel lazy.
        - Example of my typesetting could be found in <a href="http://etds.lib.ntu.edu.tw/etdservice/view_metadata?etdun=U0001-3105201722255200">my thesis</a>.

     stars: 3
     level: intermediate
     general: Mainly user configuration (the many dotfiles), but experience enough with system administration to know where to look for information(I use <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Archlinux</a>, so this is pretty much a requirement). Shell scripting (for me) has been replaced by python for better clarity, but still used for quick-and-dirty file parsing.
     specifics:
       - <a href="https://github.com/yimuchen/UnixConfig">My many dot files</a>.
       - Familiar with the commond grep, sed, with regex, globbing (wildcards), and command line piping for quick file filtering and editing.

     level: intermediate
     general: Commonly used git commands are no problem, also has experience with <a href="#research">multiuser collaboration</a>. Specific use cases will require extensive re-googling, but hey, at least it isn't <a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/">this</a>!
     specifics:
       - <a href="https://github.com/yimuchen">My many github repos</a>. Most of them are for single user purposes.
       - <a href="https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Ayimuchen+archived%3Afalse+">My collaboration experience on github</a>, mostly small incremental changes to packages.

     level: intermediate
     general: Understands the basic principle of each aspect of web frontend design, but not experienced enough to build a new, nice-looking static website from scratch.

factexp: "These are facts about me that I feel are worth mentioning, but doesn't fit in any of the 'professional' criterias above, but doesn't warrent an entire article on my blog. Displayed at random."

facts:
  - I had the fortune to stay in England for three-and-a-half years during my primary school education with my family. This is the main reason my preference in writing in English rather than Chinese, and (if you meet me in person) my accent.
  - 'I am a big fan of the <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/">Blizzard</a> hero shooter game <a href="https://playoverwatch.com/">Overwatch</a>!
  Mostly a casual player, but mildly interested in the competitive scene.
  I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum">plat</a>-<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pleb">pleb</a>
  <a href="https://www.overbuff.com/players/pc/ENSC-4905">support main</a>.'
  - I started learning programming using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language">visual programming language</a> <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Stratch</a> when I was a freshman in high school.
  - The performance that got me into choral music was a choral arrangement of 張雨生's "帶我去月球" by the LTSH school choir.
  - I am left handed.<br> Yes, I write and eat with my left hand. Yes, writing and using scissors sucks in general. No, I use a mouse with my right hand.
  - In less formal areas of the internet, I typically go by the tag "ENSC" (hence the name of the blog).
  - My tag 'ENSC' is an acornym of my rather self-depreciating user name 'enochnotsocool'.
  - The use of 'enochnotsocool' came about when my first email ID of 'enochsocool' was taken by someone else.
