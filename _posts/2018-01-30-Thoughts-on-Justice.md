After many years of saying so, I had finally completed the open course of [Justice - What's the right thing to do](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30C13C91CFFEFEA6) by [Michael Sandel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Sandel) of [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University).
Many of the concepts and arguments I had heard of before: [utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism), [Libertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism),
[Kantianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantianism);
and others that I had not fully heard the context of before:
["A Theory of Justice"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice) by [John Rawls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls),
and the ancient arguments made by [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_ethics).
Similar lines of thought I have had myself during this year of self-reflection, though I could not have hope to be as thorough as the great thinkers before me.
Seeing such arguments presented in such a systematic manner is both intriguing to see the flaws and complements these theories have between each other, and at the same time disheartening to see the never end of questions that such discussion bring out.

A quick disclaimer before spelling out my personal thoughts, I did *not* fully read all the reference materials in conjunction with the recordings on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30C13C91CFFEFEA6), nor did I engage in discussion on the online platform, nor did I read the book on the course.
All of my thoughts now are based on the video lecture, and some web searching on similar topics along the way.

The two theories that I had the most personal connection with are Kantianism, and Rawls.
I have yet to fully read the materials of Kantianism morality and "a theory of justice", but there is an appeal in building up this framework using the the ideas that seems global in the discussion of humanity: reason, and the intrinsic value of reasonable beings.
While I do agree that that the utilitarian approach gives a very simple way of calculating a course of action to take, the lack of a common ground for what makes a being intrinsically have value too often leads to extremely disturbing result, and only the most dead-set utilitarian would be willing to give up their life for the sake of total strangers.
It feels amazing how much actually could be answered simply by using such reasoning, particularly the argument for the ["benefit for the least-advantageous"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice#The_Difference_Principle) in Rawls' [veil of ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance), addressing my biggest gripes with Libertarian: the arrogance that one could possess rights without the conducts of society, and being ignorant of the arbitrary factors in play in society that plays undeniable roles in social inequalities.
Yet at the same time, these arguments introduces a justice that seems voided of what makes a system human.  
Disturbingly summarised by the French philosopher [Montesquieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montesquieu):

> A truly virtuous man would come to the aid of the most distant stranger as quickly as to his own friend.
If men were perfectly virtuous, they wouldn't have friends.

To me, who has been brought up in a Christian background, these words also has the uncomfortable similarities with one of the teachings of Jesus, one that I find disheartening to this day:

> Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family."
> Jesus replied, "No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."
> (Luke 9:61-62)

It feels incredulous for me to place faith in this icy cold justice, especially in the case of Christianity, where an intrinsic value of those close to you, in particular the value of family, was spelt out (albeit in a roundabout fashion) in the Ten Commandments.
Rationality has its appeal of being a guaranteed globality from which we can build up a system.
But the more I see and experience in life, the more I feel that these "flaws in rationality" is just as essential to our being human as the globality of reason.
The evident issue with the inclusion of these irrationalities into a complete theory of justice is made exceedingly obvious in the [last lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzD9P-9sj4M) with the debate on same-sex marriage.
What lies at stake of allowing the state to define what marriage is, is not simply the protection of Libertarian claims of human rights, as most advocates typically say; but rather the clash of the opinions of societies and communities to from what we collectively want out of a "just" society.
For if we are truly rationally virtuous, the notion of a state-based definition of marriage becomes seemingly redundant, and yet we still find a collective value in protecting some form of relationships over another.

The return of Aristotle's [teleology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology) reasoning in the final arguments, seems to suggest despite the great thinking of the modern days, there is no better solution other than to debate and discuss with other what the "telos" (purpose) of a construct is.
At the end of the course, we are left to embrace [Skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism), entitled to believe that the debates that have lasted as long as humans have learnt to write, will ultimately be left unanswered.
But to paraphrase Professor Sandell, we are obliged to ask these question precisely because we live out some form of the answers everyday, and we are desperate to understand what it is.
So while many have also raised the question of why I ponder these questions that exists seeming without answers, I will continue to question and wonder.
And with that, I would like to end this post with my favourite quotes throughout this course:

> Skepticism is thus a resting-place for human reason, where it can reflect upon its dogmatic wanderings and make survey of the region in which it finds itself, so that for the future it may be able to choose its path with more certainty. But it is no dwelling-place for permanent settlement... Simply to acquiesce in skepticism can never suffice to overcome the restlessness of reason. (Immanuel Kant)

> The purpose [of this course] is to awaken the restlessness of reason and see where it might lead.
(Michael Sandel)
