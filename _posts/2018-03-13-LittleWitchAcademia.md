Yes, it's another thoughts-on-a-certain-series article.
It just so happens that I am in a rather stagnated stage in my career path, and I recently discovered the a large library of shows-that-I-have-heard-about-but-never-got-round-to-watching on Netflix.
So I thought might as well use this time to catch up on the shows that I have heard a lot of good things and write down my own personal opinions on them.

I want to get a more personal gripe out of the way first: the world building/setting.
Magical world settings is something incredibly difficult to get feeling "right" for me, for whenever you build a world on some new power system, the first thought that immediately enters my mind is how one might game the system.
Even if we are to take [Magic A as Magic A](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA), is the system itself self consistent?
And do the in-universe characters interact with said system in a reasonable way?
The magic in Little Witch Academia is established as some sort of energy-pool system, with actually tangible entities for storing and transferring said energy, yet during the "decline of magic", no one ever sought to understand the source of energy, instead still referring to cryptic text for information?
While the application of magic might be niche (the heavy lifting work of magic is heavy implied to have been taken over by the technologies after the industrial revolution), how could the improbable manipulation of everyday objects ever considered to be "outdated", especially it is implied that even muggles can interact with magical entities?
These things are just sort of hand-waved throughout the entire series, and is really annoying for me whenever they are brought up.
For example, when a muggle student visits the magical fountain, he still leaves believing magic is useless when first hand encountering a potential [hyperspace arsenal](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal) first hand! How is that suppose to be a depiction of a brilliant student?

Magic worlds are incredibly difficult to get right, with the writer having to setup a fantastical world while still having all the characters interacting with this new world in a relatable manner.
But with recent series such as the Ancient Magus Bride doing such a good job, I cannot help be feel disappointed in this aspect.

With that out of the way, I could say that I thoroughly enjoyed the show for all it's 25 episodes and 2 OVAs (yes, I know the OVAs came out first, but this is the order that I watched them).
The animation is amazing, with the fluid motion and transformations perfectly showing off the whimsical side of magic.
The cast all have very distinct personalities, and while none of the personalities are unique to the show, the dynamics between the cast feels genuine and sincere, with the funny interactions feeling like actual clashes in personalities and the quieter, sober moments heartfelt and genuine.
Though the plot feels slightly bogged down by the world building above. 

By far my favourite episode is episode 8: the acid trip mind/dream exploration sequence.
