# A novel quantum paramagnetic state in iron based superconductors

Speaker: Dung-Hai Lee. UC Berkeley

## Quantum disorder

"Order" in condensed matter is strongly related to spontaneous symmetry breaking. 
Ex: when water condenses into ice, it looses continuous rotational symmetry, but we still say ice is more "ordered" than the random orientation of water

Quantum disorder describes a system where no symmetry is broken at any temperature, even at $T=0$. This is a very rare event in any system.

## Nematic state of iron based superconductors
At specific temperatures and doping concentrations, there is a phase where the original crystal's discrete rotations symmetry. 
This is a common property of all iron based superconductors.
The mechanism for this phenomenon is not well know yet, but there are two mainstream models:

  * Magnetism models: Neighboring ferro magnetic regions distorting the crystal 
  * Orbital models: The unique property of iron orbitals sponaneously breaks the rotations symmetry of each iron atom in the crystal

Why is this important? 

Right now, condensed matter is a bit of the opposite to particle physics:

  * Particle physics: We know the low temperature (low energy) approximation of the theory, and we want to know the high energy full theory
  * Superconducting: We know the large scale phenomenons, we what to work out the small scale interactions that makes the large scale theories work.

If we could work out the mechanism behind nematicism, we might be able to work out the mechanism of Cooper pair generation.


Magnetism model is more favour since the theory is simpler, and also the nematic phase is always coupled with a para-ferromagnetic phase. 
That is until the $FeSe$ super conductor was found! This single magnetism seems to break all prior knowledge based on the magnetism model
of iron superconductivity


## Quantum paramagnetism 

Since paramagnetism is a disordered magnetic state, quantum paramagnetism is a system that exhibits paramagnetism even at $T=0$
The first of such a system is proposed by Anderson, called *RVB spin liquid* in 1987, where the spin orientation of neigboring atoms are in constant 
resonace.

The questions is how to generate a Hamiltonian that could exhibit such a phenomenon.

The first attempt was to artificially introduce "frustration terms" ( abnormally large interaction from secondary neighbors in the crystal ).
But despite this, there are only finite crystal states, rather than a infinite liquid state.
For some reason, when the spin orientation symmetry is broken, the space and rotation symmetry of the crystal seems to "necessarily" break as well...
*Why?*



## Topological defect and Neel order 

Consider a 1D super fluid state, we could define the defect parameter by drawing a closed loop on the space time diagrams, and tracing the spin
orientation of the particles. If the spin revolves more than 0 times after the full loop, we say there is a "defect" in our system.

Similarly, there are techniques to classify this sort of "kinks" in our orientation vector fields in 2D systems (called the skyrmion number)
Defects are points in time where the skyrmion number is no longer concerved. The topological defect is called the *Neel monopole*

Further work could show that this defect must also effect the Berry phase of the system, and due to destructive/constructive interface. 
The Neel monopole could only be of order 4 is we are dealing with spin 1/2, this was show to be equivalent to the four finite ground states 
of the valance bond crystals.

In the case of spin 1, there are two ground states, which is apparently the nematic state of the iron superconductors.



So the conclusion is that spin interaction is not rule out as a model for being the source of high temperature super conductivity
