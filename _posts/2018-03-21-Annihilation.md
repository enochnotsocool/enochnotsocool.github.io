Recently, I was bullied by my brother into watching the movie [Annihilation](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Annihilation2018),
and boy was it a ride, so much so that I insisted that [everyone should watch it](https://www.facebook.com/enochchen123/posts/1355155527917394). This does not mean the show is good, or that it is bad, but as my brother said
when he recommended the movie to me: "it's... interesting", and in my own phrase during our discussion: "it's definitely something, I'm just not quite sure what yet".
After sparking the discussion I intended, I think I will try and break down what did and did not work for me.
As per usual, my thoughts-on articles will go **deep** into spoiler territory, and this film in particular has the most impact when you go in blind, so please watch the movie before reading this article.

What the film is marketed to be is a [Sci-fi horror](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiHorror), and surprisingly both these regards falls rather flat for the movie.

Sci-fi in Hollywood nowadays is typically fantasy-with-[technobabble](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble), something that typically hurts the movie more than making it "believable".
The explanation of what the shimmer does to reality doesn't coincide with the typical use of the term [refraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction),
and the constant use of terms like "cellular" and "DNA" distracts from the more profound impacts of what the shimmer actually does towards the latter part of the movie.

The crew's approach to the shimmer also doesn't feel very scientific or in fact very tactical.
As an example (and one of my biggest gripes), after a disappearance of the single investigator, one would think any manned approach to an unknown parameter would to ensure physical connections to the outside as a top priority (a steel cable tethering the agents to the Southern Reach comes to mind).
Other [too dumb to live](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive) moments like splitting up before properly clearing a safe parameter, randomly giving up [high-ground](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveTheHighGround) *when attacked* are, to me, the critical mishaps in a supposedly "[intellectual movie](https://screenrant.com/annihilation-movie-netflix-international-why/)" that make the "horror" not work out as well as it might have.
It breaks from the unsettling nature of the shimmer by making us think the unpleasant could have been circumvented if the crew acted a bit more [genre-savvy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalGenreSavvy).

The narrative structure also breaks up the suspense of what will happen to our protagonists: we know Lena would make it out alive, and that something will eventually happen to [all other party members](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll), and the [uncanny valley](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley) can only be used so much for unsettling the audience
(not to say that [talking bear](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NightmareFuel/Annihilation2018) wasn't giving me [unpleasant](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationHorror) flash-backs to a talking animal in [another franchise](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist)).

There is also numerous plot threads that just... exist: Dan is just this asshole that exists for a artificial motive, the self-destructive tendencies of the crew is just there for an exposition dump, Lena must an expert on cancer because mumbo-jumbo about cancer analogies, there is a time skip when entering because we must mess with the audience before revealing what the shimmer does.
While never prevalent enough to be intrusive to plot development, it was distracting and rather annoying.

With all that said, these are very generic things that I dislike about "science fiction" Hollywood movies.
While a more polished writing is desirable, it wasn't what made or break this movie for me, and certainly isn't what made me linger on the question of whether it is a good or bad movie for so long.

One thing that definitely made the movie stand out is the portray and stylising of the mystery surrounding the shimmer, becoming more and more stylised towards the finale.
The visual, in the movies own words, "dreamlike... nightmarish... [but] not always", makes Annihilation one of the more visually diverse life-action movies I have seen in a while, while never giving up a uniformed atmosphere for what is the shimmer.
Be it the more grotesque images with the overgrown marine, or the more serene scenes of the man-trees (tree-people?) and the crystal trees at the lighthouse, these depictions of the shimmer always instilled a sense of unease and unfamiliarity, while also keeping a strange naturalness to how everything looked.
The visual style is even more fascinating towards the end of the movie, where everything about the shimmer is conveyed entirely using the visuals with extremely minimal dialog.

All the fantastical visuals in the world, however, would not be relevant if it was not propping up an intriguing underlying theme, and this is where I have been so hesitant to "rate" this movie: at the end of the day, what *is* this movie trying to say?

It's definitely not about saving the world, as whether the world needed saving or if it was saved at all is still left unanswered; not helped by the fact that the entire crew seems rather indifferent about whether the mission succeeds or not.
It's not about self-annihilation, the destructive tendencies of the crew are never explored beyond the fact that they exist let alone resolved, and is not even the reason for the demise of any of the crew.
It's not about the consequences of encountering alien life or powers, as the implications of what such a amoral entities means to the humanity only ever had the one theme of destruction and was never explored further than that.
It's not about the philosophy of individuality, being only touched on in fleeting snippets of dialog towards the end of the movie.
Could it just a complete jumble of themes loosely tied together by disturbing images and an intentionally [mind-screwy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew) plot elements, as some critics seemed to have concluded?

I, for one, am borderline agreeing with there isn't a point to the story, if it wasn't for another argument that was somewhat jokingly made by my other brother when he tried to search for interpretations of Annihilation, and having seen an interpretation of another (in)famously mind-screwy movie: [End of Evangelion](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion), presented
by [Folding Idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAMAwErYRpQ).
The take away from the video is: what a media is trying to say, whether intentional or not, could be on a more [meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta) level then the actual medium itself, attempting to engaging in a different method of conversation with the audience.
The argument given for Evangelion is that the two strikingly different endings with the protagonist having stark different personas is made to challenge the fans of the show about the reason behind their demanding a alternative ending.
Under this light, one might say that the Annihilation movie itself is a weird self-analysis, constantly merge forms and changing what we expect --- even what we want from the movie. Annihilation is challenging the audience to question why they are watching such a movie.

   This "alien" is in fact the embodiment of what the movieis displayed on the screen. It has stunning visuals that is both dreamlike and nightmarish; engaging but at the same time indifferent.
   After its inevitable termination, we will never know what it wants, or if it wants at all.

This is, of course, just a idea for laughs. End of Evangelion (and Evangelion 3.0) gets off with this meta explanation for it long history of [love--hate relation](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank) between its fan-base and its [creator](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideakiAnno).
As a standalone adaption to a single entry in a [science fiction trilogy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSouthernReachTrilogy), and the clunky writing for the first half of the movie, such explanation comes of as somewhat forced, even more so if the creators stepped out to claim it to be so.

It does, however, gives an explanation of why I was personally hooked during the first watching, despite not knowing how I feel about the movie.
The build-up is ever changing, and I was forced to constantly reevaluate what I was supposed to expect, especially towards last 30 minutes of the film.
After the initial hook, and keeping my interest despite the clunky execution during the Southern reach act and the first act inside the Shimmer, it was a roller-coaster of a ride after that: full of swerves with what to expect, but never so abrupt that it feels like being hit on the head.
In other words, this movie is mind-screw done (mostly) right.
It must be stressed that mind-screw does not equal intelligent.
There were nearly no thought-provoking moments or messaged in the movie; not much could be taken away after the credits roll.
It is the playing with expectation of what *to* expect that makes the movie a rather unique experience.

If I were to say the critic that sums up the movie the best, I would say it is [this one from the Economist](https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2018/03/predator-pretensions):

> [Annihilation (2018)] is tightrope-walking the fine line between open-ended, mind-expanding mystery and lethargic, pretentious twaddle.

I would definitely say that for many, it would get stuck in the land of boring, pretentious rambling.
If the initial hook doesn't make it, then the movie would definitely feel like a flop.
But I for one am definitely glad that I had the chance to experience it, and greatly appreciate the risks the director took in making this movie what it is.
Whether this experience is a positive or negative one, it might not matter as much as I had thought.
