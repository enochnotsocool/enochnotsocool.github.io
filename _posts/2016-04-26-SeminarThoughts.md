Today I was given the most infuriating and insulting talk I have every attended. Even the aggressive and controversial TED talks doesn't end with me having a feeling of being offended, but this talk manage it somehow. Lets try and break it down as to what rubbed me the wrong way so as to leave with with such a foul taste in my mouth what the talk was finally over.

What the talks claims to be about is "How to Versitilely Adapt to the Digital Era". But it is scarely about that. Instead it is a terrible mashup of epistemology and eastern philosophy. Not that this sort of a topic is bad. I find a good research of eastern philosophies in the light of western methodologies (and vice versa) very intruguing. But I stress: a **good** research. These sorts of discourse typically falls flat on its face, because they typically end up just throwing around big and foreign concpets that sound fancy, but makes no sense in context. Then comes the spiral from grace that follows when attempting a more subtle discussion. When questioned about ambiguous logic or statements, the most common reply is:

>> "Oh, but I might be wrong, there is still work to be done."

So there might be wrong, but in which direction? How could the work be done? No answer. Well this question might be too grand for a budding field, to lets try and pin down some loose concepts that I might be understanding, for instance, why do you say *[concept]* when it isn't typically refered to this phenomenon?

>> "Oh, but my [concept] is not the same as the [concept] people refer to."

Conventions exist for a reason, breaking it for no apparent reason leads to needless confusion. If you are going to break it, At least try and give a reason as to what context/concept you are trying to convey. But no, everything is kept pleasently vauge to suit whatever is needed to display the diagram on the slide. A theory that answers everything a theory that answers nothing, so without context, How could you expect me to have any idea as to what you are saying? And I make when asked why you use this pharse out of context comes the slap-in-the-face comment:

>> "You mustn't be so narrow-minded. You will never understand my [concept] this way."

Well, sorry for actually *putting effort* in understanding what other people over the years have put together. Are you really so arrogant that you think you could come up in your single life-time something so impressive that you could just hand-wave all other existing works out of site? Just because your example is torn apart by a five-second wiki search, doesn't automatically make your idea on that is so radically new that it must be correct.

To me, this is the most insulting part of this so-called research. In your pointless noun dropping, you insult the effort of the people that have actually spend their time and effort building and making what we know, making it look as if you are the only sane person. And for putting effort in trying to understand other peoples work, it is somehow my fault that I don't get your convoluted *logic*.

The irony of this talk is that despite being about adapting to the digital age, most of what the presentor said is could be dashed to pieces with simple google searches. Wonky fact and knowledge that could be taken apart in a 10 minute googling session could hardly contain the "wisdom" it so passionately claim to host. I don't care if you mix and mash stuff together to make a pretty presentation, or to publish a book. At least have the decency to admit wrong when pointed out. and don't act like you are the saint that will bring about a new order that will last 2000 years. You are not. No-one in their life-time every is.

In the end I think this talks was not thought-provoking, not inspiring, not informative, anti-educational on the topics "referenced", and not even entertaining in how bad it is. I sincerly hope that this sort of talk will ever be hosted on a compulsory course in out department, or indeed any department ever again.
