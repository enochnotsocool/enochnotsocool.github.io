Over these few years, I have attempted to assist in the creation of some websites for different groups people. Apart from [this very website]({{site.url}}) website, where the content is entirely my own, the experience has been... unpleasant to say the least. The Kavalan Week Website (which died), a new website for NTU Chorus (which never took off), reorganising the website for [ECES](http://blog.ilc.edu.tw/blog/blog/35391) (which feels like it is dying), and most recently, a new website design for our experiment group (which feels like it will die before official taking off). And after this final failed attempt, I think I finally understand why.

Web design still is surprisingly fun for me, the same type of fun as getting something to look nice in a LaTeX document, or fixing all the weird artefacts in a figure or image. There is something inherently satisfying about getting an idea of your to look just right, to make it into something where you can show off to the world what you have put so much effort into. This is most likely the reason why I chose to use my  [bio]({{site.url}}/pages/spec/) and [stamp tool]({{site.url}}/pages/tools/stamp/) as my past time over the past couple of months. While it isn't as interesting or as challenging as I find other subjects, they still provide exercises that I thoroughly enjoy.

But there is one process that I despise about making/organising these websites, which once you grow accustom to the pretty layouts and fancy animations, what ultimately gives these projects longevity, and that is making content.
And this is where I fail miserably.
This is not something unique to web making:
The only real LaTeX document worth noting for me is my masters thesis, where I was pretty much forced to collect all of my thoughts into a comprehensive manner.
But looking at all the dead projects, I actually don't know what sort of content to put on them, and I have never put the effort into actively searching for content either.
Whether it feels too laborious to complete stand-alone content, or I feel unjustified for making it with the vastness of the information on the web, I always find some excuse or other to leave the project hanging, ultimately leading to its death.
With the latest rendition of the group website, it all felt cool and exciting when I was still messing around with getting Jekyll to work the way I want it to, but when contemplating writing a proper tutorial for getting into the works in my group, the thought that immediately popped into my head was "huh, maybe I don't want to spend 12 hours re-describing what I already know".
Then follows a chain of excuses of "no-one will know how to use it", and "this isn't my work soon, so why should I bother", and "it will be dead soon after anyway"... leading me more and more in favour of abandoning the project all together.
All of this makes me feel rather hypocritical, being an self-proclaimed advocate for proper documentation in our field, when I also despise the works required for such documentations to exist.

This blog/website has no deadline, and I could pretty much talk whatever I want without any thought to what the consumer might want, leaving this the only survivor of this mentality, though entirely an exception, as updates, even here, is few and far between.
I like the excitement of starting a new projects of these sorts, but this enthusiasm only makes me feel worse when I have to ditching the project, after I have already put so much effort into it but not enough to put on display.
Maybe it is time to properly give up on these projects all together?
