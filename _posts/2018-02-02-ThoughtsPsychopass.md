As a practice of expressive writing, I thought I would give it a shot to write an article on what I thought about the [Psycho Pass](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass) anime.
This is not a review, as you should not decide whether to watch this show based on what I write, and I will  go deep into spoiler territory;
rather I will focus on expressing my personal opinions on the show, trying to break down why somethings work or didn't work for me.
The only works I have watched are the two anime seasons, not [the movie](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie), nor any extended works, cannon or otherwise.

For some people saying that the premise of Psycho Pass is silly, I have to say I agree.
Both from the underlying philosophical standpoint, and the world building in general.

Urobuchi's writing has a common philosophical theme running in the three shows that I have watched:
the dangers of acting for the sake of "the greatest good for the greatest number", and the attempt to assign a calculus to a course of action, the common quotes used to summarise [utilitarianism](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EthicalHedonism).
Though used for great effect in other shows, this premise fails particularly in Psycho Pass for trying to build an entire society around such a [construct](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalitarianUtilitarian).
Regardless of how implausible this could be (something I find ridiculous considering the copious amount historical debates on such ideas), how such principles are carried out seems to follow the most shallow form of the utilitarian principle: get things done right here right now, with little consideration to anything otherwise.
[Exploding](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode) citizens in the immediate proximity of another feels like an extremely silly way of "removing" utility defects, made even sillier when the whole premise is based around utility being some measure of the human psyche.
While it was revealed that the Sibyl system does place emphasis on long-term planning, the first few case in the system simple feels devoid of any such considerations, something directly reflected in the weapons been given given three courses of actions: [instakill](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill), [tranquillising](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunGuns), and nothing; all while requiring law enforcement to "do whatever the gun tells you to do".
A more mature utilitarian would follow more akin to what Akane does in the series, using the same utilitarian arguments of long-term effects of victims and society.
Comparatively, the second season's discussion of whether a self-consistent justice system can exist at all, and whether justice should pass judgement to a collection, even if the individual might not have done anything wrong feel a much more compelling theme for philosophical discussion.
Though given the existing premise, and execution of the second season (something I will get to later), these questions are not actually explored, and seems just to be a topic brought up in an attempt to deepen the themes of season two.

The Sci-Fi/[Cyberpunk](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk) elements is also something that I didn't quite like about the show.
General technology is typically the ability to do more with less effort, and good Sci-Fis depicts this in a way that is both engaging and believable.
The depiction of technology in Psycho Pass feels like too much is there for the sake of spectacle while not actually being functional.
A specific example would be the criminal disposal weapon -- the dominator: the moving parts of the gun feels like it [serve no purpose](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool) other than a visual cue of the weapon changing modes, despite it already having an audio cue; while all the time the mode of execution feels overly spectacular. Wouldn't it have felt more advanced for the dominator to simply be a tranquilliser with a lethal-overdose mode, while the apparent non-violent method of disposing a potential criminal make depicting how messed up the Sibyl System is more subtly?
I'm not entirely opposed to a more flashy depiction of future tech, but too often then not the spectacle gets in the way of what could make the experience deeper.

Before writing more positive things about the show, lets address [the elephant in the room](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom) regarding the premise of Psycho Pass: the implementation of the Sibyl System as a [hive-mind](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind) [brains](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU) of literal [psychopaths](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath).
I didn't mind it so much, though I did miss the funny commentary that a society ran by uncondemmable psychopaths [in the name of justice](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans) (as it very well could be now) is probably more disturbing then having society ran by a deterministic algorithm.
I would say that it makes the overall setting even more improbable, but does take much from the already existing arguments, while at the same time keeping the progression of the plot more character orientated.
Is it the best setting you could have come up with? Probably not, but given the already messed up setting, I didn't really mind it that much.

Now let's talk about the thing I really enjoyed in the first season: the character interactions.
What hooked me when watching the show was not so much exploring this new world, which we already know is going to be a [crap-sack world](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld), but experiencing and understanding about how the characters interact this bizarre setup.
How people take sides when ideals are in conflict, how they do or do not change when meeting with new people, how people change what they think when something new is revealed that challenges their original ideals.
The execution of these elements are what made Psycho Pass (and Urobuchi's previous work [Fate/Zero](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero)) an interesting watch.
The characters all have reasonable and/or relate-able motives with corresponding actions, all the while we are left to question ourselves whether or not what someone did was the "right" cause of action.
Even the villain, while being set as a incomprehensible psychopath, still has a reason for behaving the way in the series, and we are challenged to propose what is wrong with his actions and what our perceived right course of action would be given the circumstances.
Despite me saying that I didn't like the philosophical theme of the first season as much, there is a sense of resolution of the characters understanding what is at stake, both direct in-world consequences and the ideal they are trying to uphold.

Something I didn't notice could be the problem was how subtle and obscure the differences in the moral standpoint of the Sibyl System and our main protagonist is.
While both agree that the system should exist (at least for now), how they came about to such a conclusion is rather important in how to distinguish the two.
Sibyl enforces the protection of the system itself, treating it own actions of taking human lives as a means to perpetuate what it considers a good society.
And while Akane states that "the people should protect the system (law), for it is the accumulation of what people thinks is precious", making it look like she is also for "protecting the system", there is a profound but obscure difference in allowing the act of choosing which law one should follow, societal or otherwise, a key example used in lectures when discussing the difference between a consequential morality (utilitarian, Sibyl), and the introduction of the uninfringeability of certain rights (basis for Libertarian, and Kantian).
Had I not come freshly out of the course, I too might have thought that Akane is just a wide-eyed idealist who was struggling to come up with words to confront what is placed before her.
I maybe reading too hard between the lines here, but I do think the depiction of the struggles in ideals is there, and in a rather clever manner.

In comparison, while there is a huge amount of reoccurring characters in season two, the same characters seems to lack the resolve that made the characters interesting in the first season.
The first season had the advantage of having the protagonists being challenged with the world beginning directly at S1E1, and without that conflict in season two, we are left waiting for the motivation of the villain up to S2E8.
At the same time, the challenges our protagonists face feel too artificial, leaving very impact on our characters.
Though the "omnipotent paradox" and it's implication on any justice system was directly spelt out by the main cast, it never really altered or rival any opinions that the cast already held, nor is it implied to have changed the plot had our protagonists know otherwise, in the end feeling rather like an intellectual gimmick for our protagonists than an actual plot point.
How these paradoxes were "resolved" also felt too much like clumsy exploit of what the Sibyl system actually is, with the solution not actually propelling further character development.

The power creep of the villains in between seasons also feels way too high.
With Kirito being the elite-hacker, hologram specialist, pharmacist, psychotherapist, and invisible transport man of the villain group.
Despite having more on-screen followers, he seems too much like a one-man army that directly challenges the Sibyl system one-on-one.
Also his ideals for reasoning was never spelt out, being a compassionate revolutionist in one scene, and being a indifferent sociopath allowing a whole pharmacy of people to be exploded the next.
You can say that given the nature of the questions the second season was trying to answer, it should only be natural that this is the case: a deranged hive-mind trapped in a human body;
then I would argue that his super human abilities was not portrayed very well: at no point was it stated that he can aggregate and process information faster than a regular human, nor was the disassociated personalities ever shown together.

All in all, I would say this is a very good show (the first season at least). I probably wouldn't be re-watching it anytime soon, as the more gruesome scenes is rather fatiguing to watch. It has interesting characters doing interesting things, and that is what makes shows these days standout.
