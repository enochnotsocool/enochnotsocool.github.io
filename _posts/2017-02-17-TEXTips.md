Though the use of [latex](https://www.latex-project.org/) in [one](https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/) [flavour](http://www.luatex.org/) [or](xelatex) [another](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConTeXt) to typeset is almost a requirement in scientific academia, people don't seem to extent their usage of latex outside basic [document structuring](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure),  [mathematics typesetting commands](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics) and [table figure insertion](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions). As with any tool provided by the open source community, all variants of latex is packed with features to make this tool your own. But unfortunately, these features are obscured by a sheer amount of documentation available and the typically steep learning curve of getting started with these tool. What I want to share is my experiences with using some of the feature to make *my* experience in writing latex much more pleasant, while trying to list all the relevant documentations to help you get started on the finding out features on your own.

## Disclaimers
This will not be a tutorial to get started with latex, you can find a hand list below.

In many cases, latex will **not** be the typesetting tool you want to use! Do not attempt to start debates on why one typesetting system is better than another based on the contents I share.

The tips I share will not be definite guidelines on how to use latex, rather a way to help you get started with changing latex behaviour to satisfy your own needs. Tools should be tailored to the user and not the other way around.
