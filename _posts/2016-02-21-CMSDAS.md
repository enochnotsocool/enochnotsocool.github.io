So the school of five days have ended, and what an enjoyable time it has been.
I didn't post my thoughts last time for CMSDAS@ Korea, having just picked up Jekyll/markdown at the time,
(and of course, being lazy at the time). So I think it is time for my to post a proper entry in my website.

## The Most Memorable Event: Friday Dinner
We had a crazy dinner at [參和院](http://sanhoyan.com.tw/news.html) friday night. On a whim, I thought might as try sitting on at a table with the most number of strangers. And what a experience it was!

When I first sat down, I had a nagging dread that this table was going to be one of those awkward, quiet dinners where every one would be eating and waiting for someone else to being a topic (happened during the dinner at CMSDAS@Korea). But this time we had a few advantages. One is that this dinner is around a lazy-susan table rather than a buffet, so there is less excuse for leaving the table during a silence, we are encouraged to find a new thing to try and talk about. The second is that there are three very outgoing people at our table, the two professors from the Computing team at CMS, and a  post-doc from riceton that another person frequently refers to as someone who is "too international".

Though slowly at first, talking began a to get easier. Then I had the feeling that I might become the silent weirdo who doesn't talk with anyone. I guess there is the fact that I am one of the only two people at our table that can speak Chinese. And from the more off-handed stuff, like "what is in this dish?", and "how do you say 'A' in Chinese?", to more close at home stuff like what I am working on, and how I got my accent. No one was particularly pushy about anyone to answer another particular question, but the primers started a very easy atmosphere with some pleasant, kind hearted chit-chat, I hadn't thought that talking with people I would usually consider stranger would be so easy!

## The Most Intriguing conversation
During the ride to the dinner, I had the oppotunity to talk with the post-doc participating CMSDAS in our group. She Had been doing SUSY related analysis work before working on hardware, then thought it was a good idea to get keep up with some of the newer technologies in analysis works in CMS. When asked why change to doing hardware, she gave me a rather gritty view of some works behind analysis work.

In a huge team of anlyzers, the work begins to evolve into the task where every one works on a small part of the analysis, for the sake of pushing the limits from current data up by a few GeVs, but your hard work for a whole year could be made obsolete in just half a year, with other teams competing to push the envolope just that tiny bit more, and it becomes very discoraging to work with. Hardware work gave more of a sense of leaving an impact. Though you know that your work isn't going to be in the detector forever, you still feel that you have done something that impact the work of others for a time.

This is rather different from the advice that I got a year ago from the post-doc that was supervising me at the time. That working on hardware was more time consuming and in the end more overlooked by the physicists.

I guess it all boils down to what you find importance in, and especially in huge collaborations like the CMS, it becomes so much easier to feel insignificant. Kind of a "One huge step for man, one tiny step for mankind" scenario. Finding what is worthwhile for yourself may not be easy, but the journey could none-the-less be fasinating.


## The Long Exercise
This experience is wildy different from the long excercise at Korea. Most of the scripts are well prepared, we essentially only tune some input parameters to reproduce the final result. But it does give me a lot of time to think about how [the analysis](cms.cern.ch/iCMS/analysisadmin/get?analysis=SUS-15-002-pas-v7.pdf) was done and why. Comparitively, the analysis I am working on in NTUCMS is so much more simpler.

The most important lesson was the comment made by our professor, that once you understand the background, then the analysis is mostly complete. Right now so much effort is poured into trying to understand the data, to know how we could understand the standard model processes from different regions of the phase space to fill in the gaps we cannot access, to remove all our artificial artefacts from our simulations, before we begin to think about probing for new physics. Understanding the background is in and of itself a great work of art with so many differnt thing to try out. I guess this is what I feel facinating about working with something like this: how to make the unknown known, even if it is just a few small steps at a time. I might be the preperation for the huge leap that we are not yet sure to be comming!


## Conclusion?
It is kind of funny to say there is any 'conclusion' to any activity, all I can say is I had a wonderful time and enough food for my thoughts to last my quite a while. I few months from now I probably cannot remember how to remove neutrino pair production backgrounds, but having the time thought about it, having the change to scrutinize these questions and learn how other may approach these problems gives me a great chance to reflect some aspects of my own analysis and get the most out of even the simplest of tasks in the analysis.
