Prior to today, I would normally commented on what is taught in school before university, that the material doesn't serve any purpose to bridge the gap between general education and advanced knowledge, being stuck in the middle ground of being too mundane to anyone is interested in pursuing a career and too tedious for someone that isn't.

But recently I have been having second thoughts on this statement. The real problem is that we are not used to appreciating the thing we are force to learn in a light of what we could appreciate.  So we know that a pulley/lever/gear system does this and that. We know that this guy lived so many years ago and did this and that. We know that we could define a congruence triangle using this angle and that line. We know that if we go to this part on the globe we would see this and that climate...

> So what?

Why should I put effort in knowing these thing? Why should we care? Were we at any point incentivize to care about these things? All of these are part of "promises of a better future", a future that is only vaguely touched upon, that we never see, hear or experience. So of course we are eager to rush into worlds of fantasy of other excitements that these thing that "we are suppose to know" never provided. I’m not talking about whether everyone has the traits and abilities for higher education (that is another problem entirely). Rather that even for those who might have been brilliant, has all incentives slowly crushed out of them.

But even the simplest material, ones that we might think we know the best, could still bring new surprises if taken into an new light. For example:”What on earth happen to the paper when it was folded seven times by a machine? Could I do the same? Is there any connection with the properties of paper we know? Could we test what I think is right?” This challenge of what you think you understand, this sense of anticipating that there might be something amazing if we could go just one more step, shouldn’t this in and of itself be a much stronger motivation that any test paper?

We are never taught why we should appreciate the works we are being taught, we are being taught as if we already do. So rather than being eager to find out more, we get the sensation that we are dragged into a forest that we "never wanted to go to in the first place". Learning should be an exciting trip into a deep wood, with someone to point out all the interesting and intricate details we might have missed, and just maybe, some of us would want to become adventurers of our own to go find places in the wood that no-one else has been to. But the first step, the "making us want to go" step, seems to have been dropped somewhere down the line. And we desperately need to find it again.
